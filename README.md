# Projection-Engine

## Abstract
Projection Engine is a Visual and Interactive Application or Engine for Visualizing
Mathematical Concepts, Playing a Simulation including Scientific and Mathematical Theories, Data
Visualization, Object Renderings. This is multi-functional 3D Graphics Rendering Engine built on top
of Python Programming and some libraries including Numpy, Sympy, Numba and Pygame

The project is for educational purpose only. This is an application where the user or the learner can
learn some Scientific and Mathematical theories and concepts by interactively playing on Simulated 3D
Eucledean Space.

Algorithms, Calculus, Linear Algebra, Vector Calculus, Computer Graphics, Physics, Simulation and
Modeling, Object Oriented Programming , Automata Theory, these are some of the areas of study to
which the Project belongs to.

The application of the project can also be considered as ‘Study Tool’, or ‘Playground’ , where a learner
can learn in interactive visual way instead of traditional way of learning and exploring concepts of
Math, Science and Computer Science.
